## Daniel Tooke

A student at Makers Academy in the March 2018 Cohort. I am looking for work as a junior developer to gain experience in full stack development.
<!-- I'm a motivated and highly versatile individual, a thinker in need of constant stimulation, and all-round excitable person. -->

My background is in Classical music, but having now made a decisive move into programming, I've found a mode of work that brings all my strengths and motivations perfectly together. It's such a joy to no longer be a square peg in a round hole.

## Skills

#### Excellent Communication Skills

I consider my communication skills to be my greatest asset. I've been lucky enough to hone them in a wide variety of contexts, whether as a teacher of unruly Guyanese schoolchildren, through tutoring undergraduate students in music, or in writing and directing plays!

At Makers Academy, close communication has been front and centre throughout our pair programming sessions and group work. I'm particularly happy breaking down and explaining code to another developer, and where necessary, teaching any new elements. The feedback I've received from other members of my cohort is that as a pair programmer I'm patient, very friendly, and able to tackle problems in a shared headspace.

#### Creative Problem Solving

Problem solving was, for me, the main draw of a career software development. Finding creative solutions to problems is incredibly invigorating, and for me the process is just as important as the eventual solution. I insist on understanding all constituent parts of a problem, and seeing their interaction fully realised in a solution.

My sense of humour also works rather laterally, which is said to indicate an ability to find new ways to approach problems...!

## Education

### Makers Academy (March 2018 to June 2018)

Makers Academy is an intense, highly selective 12-week coding bootcamp. I have been greatly enjoying my time here and graduate in June 2018. Aspects of the curriculum have included:

- Projects in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript, with an emphasis on Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- An emphasis on Agile and XP values, and an understanding of industry best-practice
- All our code exemplifies Test-Driven Development (TDD), typically with RSpec and Jasmine, but also with testing frameworks written from scratch.
- Many of our projects are web-based, hosted by frameworks such as Sinatra, http-server, and Rails, and deployed by services such as Heroku. We have also used SQL and MongoDB for database storage, and have been concerned to correctly deploy MVC.
<!-- - Experience at learning how to learn

- Curious and passionate about code. [PROVIDE EVIDENCE]
- Fast, independent learner [PROVIDE EVIDENCE]
- Great collaborator [PROVIDE EVIDENCE] -->

## Selected Experience

**Well-Typed LLP** (September 2016 to Present)    
*Assistant Business Administrator*

As Assistant Business Administrator I am responsible for all aspects of the firm's administration, including sending and receiving invoices, upkeep of accounts and paying contractors. All of the firm's records are written in Haskell, so I have been working with these and interacting with homemade programs to perform functions such as VAT returns.

**Leeds University** (October 2016 to January 2018)   
*Postgraduate Teaching Assistant*

I taught the Music Research Skills module to undergraduates for two consecutive years. <!-- Expand this! -->

**Cambridge ESOL [English for Speakers of Other Languages]** (October 2008 - September 2010)
*Exams Administrator*

As an exams administrator I was a typesetter responsible for creating proofs of exam papers. Given the nature of this work I ended up using macros to automate the most repetitive tasks, which might perhaps have indicated an aptitude for programming earlier than I realised!

- I am a keen home chef, and often note that I take a similar approach to cooking as in coding: working methodically, with a focus on best practice (knife skills, mise en place) and an understanding of my ingredients and methods built from the ground up. And I very happily 'eat my own dog food'...!

- I have an unbroken streak of 1300+ days' language learning on Duolingo. When I set my mind to learning something, I keep at it!

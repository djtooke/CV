## Daniel Tooke

I'm a software engineer for [Hive Learning](http://github.com/hivelearning), developing backend services in Python.

I highly value best-practices (such as Agile and XP values), and understanding code from the very fundamentals upwards; as such I thrive in environments where mastery and deep understanding of code is highly prized.

I'm a motivated and highly versatile individual in need of constant stimulation, and all-round excitable person. My background is in Classical music, but having made a decisive move into programming, I've found a mode of work that brings all my strengths and motivations perfectly together. It's such a joy to no longer be a square peg in a round hole.

## Programming experience

**Hive Learning**   
*Junior Software Engineer, July 2018 - Present*

I currently work as a software engineer developing backend services for Hive Learning. We've been preparing to roll out Version 4.0 of our app, which is a complete rewrite of the app in a brand new stack, with an event-driven microservice architecture and a frontend in React Native. As such I've been involved in a very exciting and hands-on period of writing a number of features of the app from scratch. My experience with the stack has included:

- Writing and testing backend services in Python, with tests written using its built-in Unittest library
- Creating APIs to be hosted in Kubernetes/docker containers or AWS, with documentation and validation through Swagger and API Gateway. These have communicated variously with internal and external APIs and used a number of different open source libraries.
- Publishing and reacting to events in a fully event-driven architecture
- Storing and retrieving items from databases, with object wrapping in Python (SQLAlchemy)
- Indexing and retrieiving items in Elasticsearch for our app's search engine
- Working with frontend programmers on a shared specification for each service
- Documenting code in Readme files and Docstrings
- Working with AWS Specifications and permissions for different services
- Implementing multithreading and multiprocessing where appropriate

**Makers Academy**   
*Student, March 2018 - June 2018*

Makers Academy is an intense, highly selective 12-week coding bootcamp. I greatly enjoyed my time here and graduated in June 2018. Aspects of the curriculum included:

- Projects in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript, with an emphasis on Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- An emphasis on Agile and XP values, and an understanding of industry best-practice
- All our code exemplifies Test-Driven Development (TDD), typically with RSpec and Jasmine, but also with testing frameworks written from scratch.
- Many of our projects were web-based, hosted by frameworks such as Sinatra, http-server, and Rails, and deployed by services such as Heroku. We have also used SQL and MongoDB for database storage, and have been concerned to correctly deploy MVC.

**Well-Typed LLP (September 2016 to September 2018)**   
*Assistant Business Administrator, September 2016 - September 2018*

As Assistant Business Administrator I was responsible for all aspects of the firm's administration, including sending and receiving invoices, upkeep of accounts and paying contractors. This was not strictly a development job, but all of the firm's records were written in Haskell files, so I was upkeeping these and interacting with homebuilt programs through the terminal to perform functions such as invoice generation and VAT returns.

## Skills

#### Excellent Communication Skills

I consider my communication skills to be my greatest asset. I've been lucky enough to hone them in a wide variety of contexts, whether as a teacher of unruly Guyanese schoolchildren, through tutoring undergraduate students in music, or in writing and directing plays!

When coding, I especially enjoy pair programming sessions and group work. I'm particularly happy breaking down and explaining code to another developer, and where necessary, teaching any new elements. The feedback I've received from other team members is that as a pair programmer I'm patient, very friendly, and able to ensure we tackle problems in a shared headspace.

#### Creative Problem Solving

Problem solving was, for me, the main draw of a career software development. Finding creative solutions to problems is incredibly invigorating, and for me the process is just as important as the eventual solution. I insist on understanding all constituent parts of a problem, and seeing their interaction fully realised in a solution. I'm not content to poke things at random until I get lucky; I insist on gaining visibility and understanding a problem from the bottom up so as to ensure I can find a lasting solution.

My sense of humour also works rather laterally, which is said to indicate an ability to find new ways to approach problems...!

## Other Selected Experience

**Leeds University**   
*Postgraduate Teaching Assistant, October 2016 - January 2018*

As a PhD researcher in the Music Department at Leeds University, I taught the Music Research Skills module to undergraduates for two consecutive years. This was a module that focussed on best practice in academic research and writing, including using reference management software, correct formatting and processes for academic writing, and help with style, academic presentations and research processes generally.

**Cambridge ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages)**   
*Exams Administrator, October 2008 - September 2010*

As an exams administrator I was a typesetter responsible for creating proofs of exam papers for students learning English as a second language. Given the nature of this work I ended up using macros to automate the most repetitive tasks, which might perhaps have indicated an aptitude for programming earlier than I realised!

- The years 2010-18 I spent working in academia, studying and researching Classical music. This mainly centred around lots of Austrians named Arnold and Hans, as well as a Russian guy called Серге́й.

- I am a keen home chef, and often note that I take a similar approach to cooking as in coding: working methodically, with a focus on best practice (knife skills, mise en place) and an understanding of my ingredients and methods built from the ground up. And I very happily 'eat my own dog food'...!

- I speak intermediate French and German, and in particular am working to achieve fluency in French. I currently have an unbroken streak of 1600+ days' language learning on Duolingo; when I set my mind to learning something, I keep at it!

- Since 2007, my closest friends and I have put together a number of amateur dramatic productions for schools, hospitals and our own amusement. Ask me about the play I wrote about the nuns and the exploding cake.

- I lived and taught science and IT at a secondary school in Guyana for an academic year, in 2005-6. This taught me a great deal, including how to chase a snake out of your house with a machete.

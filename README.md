## Daniel Tooke

Motivated and highly versatile individual; a thinker in need of constant stimulation; all-round excitable person.

My background is in Classical music, but having made a decisive move into programming, I've found a mode of work that brings all my strengths and motivations perfectly together. It's such a joy to no longer be a square peg in a round hole.

## Skills

#### Communication skills

I've honed my communication skills in a variety of contexts, whether in presentation mode as a teacher of unruly Guyanese schoolchildren, through written academic theses and articles, or in writing and directing plays!

At Makers' Academy this skill has been front and centre throughout our pair programming sessions. I'm particularly happy breaking down and explaining code to another developer, and where necessary, teaching any new elements.
